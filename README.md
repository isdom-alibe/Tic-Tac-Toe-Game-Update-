# Tic-Tac-Toe Game ðŸŽ®  

This is a simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You can play it with a friend, and itâ€™s a great example of my ability to create interactive web applications. The game features a two-player mode where each player takes turns to place their mark (X or O) on the grid.
